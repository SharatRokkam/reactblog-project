The movie, which had a whopping 400 crore budget, featured Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Amitabh Bachchan, Mouni Roy, and Nagarjuna in significant parts. But Shah Rukh Khan's presence generated a lot of excitement among the audience, and now everyone is demanding a spin-off!
            Shah Rukh Khan who played Vanarastra and took on the persona of Mohan Bhargav, a scientist, only had a short stint during the movie. But his role won the audience's hearts and left them asking for more. Supporters of SRK started posting online petitions calling for a spin-off of his character.
            Ayan Mukerji, the director of Brahmastra, has finally addressed the topic and revealed “Before the fans were saying it, we were also saying that ourselves. When we were shooting the sequence in 2019, we were also talking on sets. As we discovered the personality of the scientist, we said, ‘Yaar, we have to do stuff. We have to do the origin story of the scientist!
            Shah Rukh Khan's role in Brahmastra, according to Ayan Mukerji, was not intended to be limited to a cameo, and his team too was pushing for more.“We were also vibing on that frequency, my assistants and I. So, I guess my response to the spin-off demand is that: We  are already thinking about it. We are hearing everything and are planning our next moves,” he added.
            Even Deepika Padukone is reportedly a part of the Brahmastra franchise, in addition to Shah Rukh Khan. Who will play the main character Dev in the future franchise is still a big mystery. One of the names that is getting a lot of attention is Ranveer Singh, and we can't wait to see who it turns out to be.`,

It was also revealed that Ranveer Singh might have a part to play in the hit franchise, however, there have been some latest updates on the script.
            The quote said, “Farhan had an ambitious idea of getting Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan together in the third installment. Interestingly, Bachchan saab was the lead in the original Don (1978). It had a different ending and showed the good-natured Vijay surviving and Don dying, while SRK’s version showed vice versa. Hence, it’s not clear whether or not Big B was supposed to play the role from the original version. However, Farhan definitely had thought of casting Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan in Don 3.”
            Earlier, as quoted on a leading entertainment portal, Farhan Akhtar had always gone on record to say he is working on the script. Along with planning to bring Amitabh Bachchan on board, he was also writing a supposed cameo role for Ranveer Singh where Shah Rukh would be seen passing the lineage onto him and be featured in the future installments as the story is carried forward.
            Farhan hasn't confirmed any of these remarks as of yet.`,

The actor has a huge fan base that supports him not only in his films but also in all his efforts to promote various causes. With the love of his fans and his undeniable charm, he's truly the binary superstar of Bollywood.
            Besides having done numerous films over the years, the actor has also championed social problems, managed to speak up for women's rights and offer martial arts self-defense classes to women. 
            Even as an actor, there is no field he hasn't explored. Right from action, comedy, romance, biopic, you name it, and Akshay Kumar has not just done it in his film career, but also aced them by breaking box office records!
            Today on the occasion of his 55th, we are deciphering Akshay's path to becoming Bollywood's "ideal all-rounder"- or, as they like to say, "One man, many roles"!
            Action 
            With Saugandh, Akshay made his Hindi film debut in 1991. However, it was his performance in the suspenseful drama Khiladi a year later that changed everything for him. It was that movie that gave him the title of “Khiladi of Bollywood.” and showcased his quick movements, action hero demeanour, and careful martial actors sequences. These earned him accolades and he gained a lot of popularity as the ultimate action hero of bollywood. His proficiency in martial arts was also highlighted by later films like Deedar, Insaaf, Daava, Barood, Zulmi, and Jaanwar, among many more.
            Rowdy Rathore, in which Akshay Kumar plays a double role is one of his most famous action films that made it to the 100 crore club and also had everyone copying his moves. Holiday, which is a remake of Tamil Film Thuppakki features Akshay Kumar as a captain in the DIA, chasing goons and saving the city from bomb blasts. The stylized action in the movie won praise. The climactic scene where Akshay destroys Freddy Daruwala and his goons, makes the ticket completely worth the price.
            More recent releases like Boss, Gabbar Is Back, Singh Is Kinng, Tashan and more recent hits like Bachchhan Pandey are also action-comedy movies where Akshay Kumar has showcased his skills effortlessly.
            Comedy While the audience was enjoying the "Khiladi's" action-oriented portrayal, Akshay had moved onto the comedy genre as a means of changing the action hero stereotype. He always spoke about the significance of reinventing oneself, saying that an actor can only grow and learn when he experiments.`,

The company is “aware of the issue and a fix will be released next week,” according to a statement emailed to The Verge by Apple spokesperson Alex Kirschner. 
            When reports of the bug started hitting over the weekend, it wasn’t clear if the issue was with the third-party apps themselves or with iOS 16, though the cameras functioned just fine in Apple’s own app. Given that it’s Apple releasing an update, it appears that the issue is with the iPhone and its APIs rather than the third-party apps.
            Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok may need to issue a special update for the iPhone 14 Pro. Even then, there is no clear picture of what type of harm (if any) this does to the camera itself, which is concerning given that this is very expensive and up equipment.
            Some users turned to Twitter to share their experiences, including videos of how the phone acted when using applications like TikTok. The phone practically shook in their hands, and it also became stuck. `,

            body: "YouTuber Hikikomori Media has a good breakdown of what the situation was before, but the TL;DR is that there’s kind of a mixed bag when you buy Xbox games on disc. Some will be branded as Xbox One games, which obviously contain the version of the game meant for Microsoft’s last-gen consoles. Other games, however, are branded as working with both the Xbox Series X and Xbox One (the Xbox Series S doesn’t have an optical disc drive to insert games into) — but sometimes, the version of the game on the disc is for the Xbox One. Before the update, you’d have to be online to finish installing these games, so your Xbox could download info that allowed them to work with the newer console.Now, you’ll be able to install the Xbox One version of the game straight from the Xbox One or cross-generation disc and start playing it. Of course, if you want to download any updates or enhancement packs for the Series X, you will still have to go online. You’ll also have to go online to play games that don’t have all of the install data available on the disc. Those caveats mean its not a full-on victory for game preservation, but in theory if Microsoft ever shut down its servers, you should still at least be able to play the version of the game you have on disc.",

            body:"The James Webb Space Telescope is still snapping its first pictures of Solar System planets, and the latest batch could be particularly useful. NASA and the ESA have shared early images of Mars, taken on September 5th, that promise new insights into the planet's atmosphere. Data from the near-infrared camera (NIRCam) is already offering a few surprises. For starters, the giant Hellas Basin is oddly darker than nearby areas at the hottest time of the day, NASA's Giuliano Liuzzi and Space.comnoted — higher air pressure at the basin's lower altitude has suppressed thermal emissions.The JWST imagery also gave space agencies an opportunity to share Mars' near-infrared atmospheric composition using the telescope's onboard spectrograph array. The spectroscopic 'map' (pictured at middle) shows the planet absorbing carbon dioxide at several different wavelengths, and also shows the presences of carbon monoxide and water. A future research paper will provide more detail about the Martian air's chemistry. It was particularly tricky to record the images. Mars is one of the brightest objects the James Webb telescope can see — a problem for an observatory designed to study the most distant objects in the universe. Researchers countered this by capturing very short exposures and using special techniques to analyze the findings.This is only the initial wave of pictures and data. It will take more observations to reveal more about Mars. However, the spectral info already hints at more information about the planet's materials. Liuzzi also thinks JWST studies could settle disputes over the presence of methane on Mars, potentially signalling that the Red Planet harbored life in its distant past.",

            body:`That purported Grand Theft Auto VI leak appears to be real. Rockstar Games has confirmed the authenticity of the leak in a tweet, noting that a hacker stole confidential data including "early development footage" of the next Grand Theft Auto title. The firm didn't foresee any long-term damage to development or live services like GTA Online, but was "extremely disappointed" that details of the future game were shared in this manner, Rockstar promised another update "soon," and that creation of GTA VI would continue "as planned." The game producer didn't share more. However, Windows Centralnotes parent company Take Two has asked original leak host GTAForums to pull content, which reportedly includes Bully 2 plans and might include code for multiple GTA titles. The hacker's original Telegram channel has disappeared. The leak is unprecedented and included 90 videos of a very early build of GTA VI. The clips appear to validate rumors from July that hinted at a return to Vice City (aka Miami) as well as a Bonnie and Clyde-like pair of male and female protagonists. There also appears to be a slew of functional upgrades ranging from improved animations to a robbery system. The GTA VI material might not do much damage, as the finished product is likely to be much more polished. However, there is a concern that any code for GTA Online could make it easier for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and otherwise sour the game for other players.`,

            body:`Four days ago, just a few minutes before 3 a.m. EDT, a long-anticipated upgrade to Ethereum was executed. Since then, the second most valuable blockchain’s cryptocurrency, ETH, has tumbled — and some are saying its price hasn’t bottomed out yet. When the upgrade, generally referred to as “the Merge,” transpired, ETH was priced at about $1,600. At the time of publication, ETH is worth about $1,327 down just over 17% from the landmark system change.
            “The FOMO and speculation around the Merge are done, and it’s back to business as usual for most in the space.” Flux co-founder Daniel Keller
            Over the past several months, speculation has centered around whether ETH would be accepted post-Merge, Daniel Keller, co-founder of a decentralized cloud infrastructure Flux, told TechCrunch. Since Ethereum moved from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), it left its crypto miners “behind” in the transition, he added.
            “Did they alienate a core demographic and remove one of the best parts of decentralization? I think we see the direct impact of that speculation to the downside,” Keller said.

            body:`European businesses, investors, and talent are all vying for a ticket on the metaverse hype train. Even political heavyweights are making moves — or, at least, pronouncements.
            French President Emmanuel Macron wants to build “a European metaverse” to challenge US and Chinese tech giants. The EU’s digital chief, Margrethe Vestager, meanwhile, is mulling new antitrust regulation. But their ambitions are a long way from being realized.
            “The reality is there is no European big tech player of relevance in that whole metaverse future,” says Rolf Illenberger, the cofounder of Munich’s VRdirect, a virtual reality platform for enterprises. “It’s being defined by US and Asian players. Those are the two regions where this technology is going to develop.”
            In the US, the tech titans of Meta, Microsoft, and Apple are set for leading roles, while Roblox and Decentraland already offer popular proto-metaverse platforms. 
            Their biggest global challengers are based in Asia. Bytedance, the owner of TikTok and VR hardware giant Pico, is the strongest contender, but further competition is emerging at the likes of Huawei, Tencent, and the Sandbox virtual world.`,

            description:`Scientists have tapped neuromorphic computing to keep robots learning about new objects after they’ve been deployed.
            For the uninitiated, neuromorphic computing replicates the neural structure of the human brain to create algorithms that can deal with the uncertainties of the natural world.`,
            body:`Loihi is comprised of around 130,000 artificial neurons, which send information to each other across a “spiking” neural network (SNN). The chips had already powered a range of systems, from an smart artificial skin to an electronic “nose” that recognizes scents emitted from explosives.
            Intel Labs this week unveiled another application. The research unit teamed up with the Italian Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich to deploy Loihi in a new approach to continual learning for robotics.
            The method targets systems that interact with unconstrained environments, such as future robotic assistants for healthcare and manufacturing.
            Existing deep neural networks can struggle with object learning in these scenarios, as they require extensive well-prepared training data — and careful retraining on new objects they encounter. The new neuromorphic approach aims to overcomes these limitations.
            The researchers first implemented an SNN on Loihi. This architecture localizes learning to a single layer of plastic synapses. It also accounts for different views of objects by adding new neurons on demand.
            As a result, the learning process unfolds autonomously while interacting with the user.`,

            body:`Woody Allen has denied reports that he is retiring, after a widely circulated article in a Spanish newspaper quoted him as saying his current film would be his last.
            Allen, 86, had been speaking to La Vanguardia before the filming of his new project, currently titled Wasp 22, in Paris. The newspaper had quoted him as saying: “My idea, in principle, is not to make more movies and focus on writing”, adding that his next project was a novel.
            A statement issued on behalf of the film-maker said: “Woody Allen never said he was retiring, nor did he say he was writing another novel. He said he was thinking about not making films, as making films that go straight or very quickly to streaming platforms is not so enjoyable for him, as he is a great lover of the cinema experience. Currently, he has no intention of retiring and is very excited to be in Paris shooting his new movie, which will be the 50th.”
            La Vanguardia also quoted Allen as saying that Wasp 22 would be “similar to” his 2005 film Match Point, and would be “exciting, dramatic and also sinister”.
            In June, Allen had expressed his disillusion with the film-making process in an Instagram Live interview with actor Alec Baldwin saying: “A lot of the thrill is gone. Now you do a movie and you get a couple of weeks in a movie house, and then it goes to streaming or pay per view. It’s not the same. It’s not as enjoyable to me.”
            Allen’s four-picture deal with Amazon Studios collapsed in 2018 in the fallout from renewed attention around allegations by the director’s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, that he had sexually abused her. Allen has always denied the allegation; two investigations were closed with no charges being brought against him.
            Allen’s memoir Apropos of Nothing was subsequently dropped by publishers Hachette, but was picked up and published by Arcade in 2020. Arcade also published Zero Gravity, his new collection of short stories.`,

            body:`Comcast is looking forward to 2024, a year in which it will gain: A) Hulu or B) a boatload of money, based on Hulu’s huge valuation. There’s also C): It could buy another significant media company, a purchase possibly financed in part by B. And let’s face it: NBCU needs one of those outcomes to compete in the streaming wars. With or without next-day NBC episodes, Peacock is no contender for the crown.
            In January 2024, Comcast will likely sell its 33 percent ownership interest in Hulu to Disney. According to a deal the companies made in 2019, Hulu is valued at a guaranteed minimum of $27.5 billion. Disney’s two-thirds ownership share has a baseline value of $18 billion with NBCU’s third at $9 billion, but only Disney contractually has to buy its partner out.
            At last week’s Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia event, Comcast CEO Brian L. Roberts pushed an alternate alternative: What if the seller becomes the buyer? 
            “If [Hulu] was for sale, put up for sale, Comcast would be interested, and so would a lot of other tech and media companies,” Roberts said. “And you would have robust auction. There’s never been a pure-play, fabulous, scaled streaming service put on the market.”
            Fabulous! And also? Unlikely. At $18 billion, that would be a very pricey buy for Comcast. Any non-Disney buyers would almost certainly no longer have access to ABC or the FX on Hulu content, and given the overall Hulu valuation of $27.5 billion (set by the owners, not necessarily the market), it’s a bid that only a trillion-dollar company would — or at least should — really consider. Amazon, which just ingested MGM, has Prime Video; Apple seems to prefer a small-scale approach; Microsoft and YouTube owner Alphabet seem unlikely to move into a very crowded streaming space that’s already ripe for consolidation. That places Roberts’ claim of Comcast interest somewhere between a threat and a shrewd negotiating tactic.`,

Any new show in the genre must now not only crown a winner, but set itself apart in order to make a lasting impression.
            Enter Hulu’s “Best in Dough,” a pizza making competition series hosted by Bachelor Nation’s Wells Adams. In each 30-minute episode Adams, along with Chef Daniele Uditi and a third guest judge, review pizzas made by various groups: Italian nonnas, social media influencers, grill masters, and more. These groups don’t compete with each other, but amongst themselves, which is a missed opportunity for the crazy chemistry of nonnas chiding college students or independent pizza makers facing off with pizza establishments. Chemistry between competitors is what pops on so many reality cooking shows, and in the three episodes screened for critics, “Best in Dough” doesn’t sit in that enough.
            At present, Hulu’s nonfiction originals are nearly all documentary or similar, except for one reality juggernaut: “The Kardashians.” “Best in Dough”s closest cousin is “Baker’s Dozen,” the Cooking Channel series where 13 bakers try to wow the judges with pastry confections. “Best in Dough” feels very much like Hulu trying to tap into the loyal audience of the Cooking Channel, Food Network, and Netflix’s “Great British Baking Show” — the OG in an ever-widening field.`,

            Sony is prominent in three different ways this week, all having significance. Although it has been the most conservative studio with windows over the last two years, it released “The Invitation” ($19.99) in an unrated version after the horror film’s third weekend, similar to what Universal does. The modest performing film didn’t soar, with only one top ten showing (iTunes, #10), though just missing at Vudu and #15 at Google Play.`,

            body:`Any description of “Los Espookys” will ultimately come up lacking, because the English language cannot create vibes that ring out with the coolness, vitality, and weirdly fused nerd-punk energy of “Los Espookys.” The HBO comedy has the same sense of care and texture and human creativity as hand-drawn animation, which is not to say that it looks unreal. But there’s a heightened quality to its visuals that perfectly matches who the characters are and the spirit of the show’s humor. You can tell the Los Espookys crew and even the hound-dog parking attendant Tico (Fred Armisen) are of, and have power over, their unnamed Latin American home. The costumes and the production design are central to creating the look and feel of Julio Torres, Ana Fabrega, and Armisen’s series about (if we must reduce it to a plot) a group of friends who run an agency that solves peoples’ problems with spooky live theater.
            The world of “Los Espookys” is one that production designer Jorge Zambrano needs to build from scratch, not just for every season but for every set and location. “From props and decor, costume design, everything is new,” Zambrano told IndieWire. “Julio told me how they work in the States and it’s very different from the way we work here [in Chile]. We have to self-make everything, mostly. So it’s a little bit of challenge the whole time.”`,

            body:`With the first flush of fall festivals behind us — we’re talking the triple whammy of Venice, Telluride, and Toronto — and the New York Film Festival just on the horizon, we’re taking stock of the best films of the circuit so far. And while it’s easy to use the fall fests as a window into this year’s awards contenders, of which many debuted over the past few weeks, including Venice winner “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” and TIFF People’s Choice hit “The Fabelmans,” the festivals have also provided us with some of the best films of 2022, full stop.
            These standouts include everything from the aforementioned winners from Laura Poitras and Steven Spielberg, plus new features from perennial favorites Sarah Polley, Martin McDonagh, Luca Guadagnino, Rian Johnson, Joanna Hogg, Kōji Fukada, and Todd Field. Rising stars aren’t in short supply either, including first narrative features from both Elegance Bratton and Alice Diop that seem likely to endure for years to come. Amongst this selection, words like “gem,” “masterpiece,” and “crowd-pleaser” are thrown around with regularity, but not without real consideration.
            Ahead, we’ve picked out the fifteen best films of the fall festival season we’ve enjoyed in recent days. Many of these films are arriving on a screen, big or small, near you soon, and those release dates are indicated, too. In short: clear your calendars.`,

            body:`In 2022, many Americans are getting married later, or not at all, and never do we find ourselves as grateful for this cultural evolution than while watching “Game of Thrones” and “House of the Dragon.”
            Sunday’s “Dragon” episode, “We Light the Day” celebrated the wedding of heir to the Iron Throne Rhaenyra Targaryen (Milly Alcock) to the powerful heir to Driftmark Laenor Velaryon (Theo Nate). The young and decidedly not in love couple are barely even related, a victory in all seven kingdoms, but their nuptials were far from uneventful, and not in a good way.
            Back in “Game of Thrones” Season 1, it was observed that “A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.” This was uttered at Daenerys’ wedding to Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), in a scene that very much depicted the nonwhite Dothraki as wild and barbaric. But the citizens of Westeros are no better; over the course of “Thrones” and now “Dragon,” it looks like weddings are the top chosen occasion for violent, vengeful murder.
            The murder in question: An innocent — if petty — Joffrey Lonmouth (Solly McLeod), Laenor’s secret lover. For reasons known only to the departed, he decides to needle Ser Criston Cole (Fabian Frankel) over their shared position as classified royal consorts, which results in Criston beating Joffrey to an actual pulp on the banquet hall floor.`,

            Why is that bizarre? Because the "Karate Kid" franchise has already returned and returned in a big way with the hugely successful streaming series "Cobra Kai," which sees a grown up Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence coming back together in genuinely unexpected and emotionally complex ways. "Cobra Kai" has wooed fans of the original franchise by playing up the nostalgia while also turning it on its head.
            LaRusso isn't the aw shucks innocent angel he was as a kid and Lawrence has a lot to make up for. Add in a whole new young cast of kids who do some karate business and you have an unlikely streaming success story that is apparently doing gangbuster business for Netflix.
            So, what the hell is this movie? A continuation of "Cobra Kai?" A reboot? A 2018 "Halloween" type of sequel that ignores everything that came before? We still don't know the answer, but we do know we can cross one of those options off.`,

            body:`Roland Emmerich's "Moonfall," released in theaters back in February, is an incredibly stupid film. That statement is not meant as a value judgment, but a mere descriptor. It could even be construed as a compliment. As overwrought, visually busy, dunderheaded disaster blockbusters go, they don't get much more unabashedly fatuous as "Moonfall." It's a film that offers synergistic enhancement to alcohol. Its dumb ideas are, if one is honest, strangely fun and appealing. "Moonfall" would make a great double feature with "Geostorm." Which was, incidentally, made by Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich's longtime writing partner. 
            The premise of "Moonfall" is simple. Earth's moon is falling from its orbit, causing flooding and weird gravitational anomalies all over the world. Patrick Wilson, Halle Berry, and John Bradley find, through a very elaborate investigation process, that the moon is not a heavenly body that formed naturally, but an ancient alien superstructure housing a swarm of tiny malevolent space bots. It turns out that billions of years ago, human-like alien ancestors living on a distant planet had accidentally created a resentful AI program that turned on it. The moon was built on said distant planet as a seeding craft to implant the Earth with human DNA. It is, as they say, a hoot. 
             Much of the action sequences in "Moonfall" center on the shifting of gravity. Not only are several scenes set aboard space shuttles or on the lunar surface, but as the moon passes closer and closer to Earth, its gravity begins lifting people — and buildings — off the ground. In a recent behind-the-scenes report from SciFiNow, the cast talked about what they had to do to ensure authenticity in their zero-gravity movements, and the trials of shooting a film during a pandemic.`,

Landmine training is performed in settings from Division 1 college weight rooms to bodybuilding gyms to injury rehab clinics.
            The barbell is used for lever-based resistance — one end pivots on the floor or in a purpose-built sleeve as the lifter moves the loaded end through space. Make no mistake, this is not flashy “training for the ‘Gram” or some gross misuse of equipment.
            The landmine provides opportunities for exercises with characteristics distinct from traditional free-weight training. The best part? Landmines offer versatility to train the entire body along with multiple components of fitness. Here, you’ll find the best landmine workouts for building serious upper and lower-body muscle, along with elite-level conditioning.

Between his film work, Hemsworth has spent some of his recent time promoting his workout application, Centr — which he started in 2019, according to an interview with Bloomberg. The latest routine from the man famous for playing Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a doozy. 
            On August 25, 2022, Hemsworth shared a 50-rep full-body workout featuring a combination of burpees, squats, lunges, biceps curls, and shoulder presses. The actor appeared to perform the respective exercises by a body of water, which may have again been on the deck of a Navy ship from the recent record-breaking blockbuster, Top Gun: Maverick.
            According to the caption of Hemsworth’s post, the workout apparently becomes more manageable as one shifts from exercise to exercise. However, and this seems like an imperative aspect, he stresses not to rest until all 50 total reps are finished. That could indicate the full-body routine emphasizes both strength and conditioning.  `,

            body:`Ab training is not only about aesthetics and making your abs look better. Yes, these workouts will check both of those boxes, but these specialized training plans can also help you understand that your abdominal muscles are highly functional, not just for show.
            Once you start training them effectively, you can end up looking better, moving better, and feeling better. These workouts may look simple, but don’t be fooled because simple does not mean easy. Get ready to build a midsection that will help you crush any workout and, if needed, anyone.
            How to Do it: Place one dumbbell on the ground and position yourself at arm’s length to the side. Begin with your hands, knees, and toes on the floor. Set shoulders directly over your wrists and your knees directly under your hips. Keep your arms straight and actively push your hands into the ground while reaching your shoulders down to engage your serratus anterior. With the hand farthest from the weight, reach across your body and then drag the dumbbell across the floor underneath you. Take three to four seconds to move the weight, which should allow you to feel your abdominal muscles working. Continue dragging the weight until your arm is fully extended. Don’t allow your body to tilt or rotate. Switch hands and return the weight to the starting position.`,

            body:`The pros of working out at home include not having to commute or comb your hair to squeeze a sweat session in during the day. Exercising at home can also be more cost-effective: Online memberships go for about the price of a fancy smoothie. (Or totally free if you head to YouTube.) The only con is that, chances are, your home lacks all the fancy (or at least large) equipment you can find at the gym. Resistance bands, however, solve that problem—especially if you're a beginner fitness enthusiast.
            Benefits of resistance band exercises
            1. Easy on the joints
            "Resistance band exercises are very much like traditional weight-bearing exercises, except that they have an anchor point and therefore engage more of the body with each exercise," says Floery Mahoney, founder of Board30, a fitness studio franchise that provides a full-body resistance band workout. "The smooth and constant tension is much better for your joints and even helps strengthen your joints, the more you use them."
            2. Increases strength evenly
            If you want to ensure a symmetrical workout, resistance bands have your back (and core, and arms—you get the gist). "Resistance band exercises increase strength evenly, both concentrically and eccentrically [meaning, when you contract and release], so your muscles are strong but more pliable and less injury-prone," Mahoney says.
            3. Builds muscle
            Resistance bands may look flimsy, but don't be fooled: They can help you build some serious muscle. "You can build muscle mass using resistance bands by increasing the tension and doing fewer reps," Mahoney says. "You can also incorporate cardio more easily than with weights," which are bulkier and more unwieldy.`,

            Camara is Well+Good’s Trainer of the Month for September, and is delivering a weekly master class in Afro dance. In week one, she taught us some of the common dance moves from around the African continent, so you may want to check out that video if you’re new to this art form.
            This week, Camara leads us in a combo that uses the whole body. You’ll be squatting and lunging but you won’t even realize it because these common strength moves are simply part of a flowing dance routine packed with energy and attitude. "Even when you're doing something kind of simple, or that feels maybe even more fitness-like, when you're dancing you have to bring some energy and feeling into it," says Camara.
            A combo might sound intimidating, but Camara breaks down each eight-count in multiple ways so that the phrases become like building blocks you’ll be able to put together. Her words of wisdom? Don’t be intimidated to try something new.`,

You get to the gym, fill up your water and get to your workout area. You know a weight lifting warm-up is key for performance and reducing injury risk so you’ve already allotted some time to build up to your actual working sets. BUT, what’s the best way to warm up safely and effectively for strength training?
            When it comes to working on your cardio or for movement based activities like running or sports, the game plan is easier. The warm-up could consist of dynamic stretches, mobilizations, muscle activations, and then simply doing whatever cardio or sport you’re doing at a lower intensity for a given amount of time. However, for strength training, there's more variables and thus, question.
            A few common ones that come to mind: How should I be warming up for my lifts? Should I do some band work? If so, what level of resistance and at what intensity? If it’s weights, should I warm up by doing the specific lifts that I’ll be doing? Should I do them all at once or immediately prior to each specific lift? How much weight and for how many repetitions should I be lifting before my first working set?`,

It’s true that I participate in races that see me on my feet for 12-plus hours at a time, sometimes for consecutive days, but do I run non-stop? The honest answer is no.
            Even elite athletes walk in ultras. Legendary runner Dean Karnazes, who has finished the gruelling 100 mile Western States ultra multiple times, is an advocate of walking the hills. And the formidable Jasmin Paris who holds the overall course record at the 268 mile UK Spine Race, power walked many sections.
            Ultras are a very different beast to marathons. Personal bests, pace per minute, and positive splits have no place on the ultra trail. For most runners the aim of an ultra is often simply to finish—the journey, rather than the time, is the goal.
            By definition, an ultra is any distance over 26.2 miles. In reality this can range from 27 miles to 3,100 miles, on single or multiday events. The field of ultrarunning is booming right now. Participation in the sport has grown 1,676% in the past two decades, with more than 600,000 people running ultras each year, according to a report by Run Repeat. And more women are running ultras too, with 23% of participants being female compared to just 14% in 1997.`,

Well, when it comes to living longer, we have a better idea, thanks to a recent study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, which looked at how power walking for longevity can be beneficial.
            The massive study followed 47,000 participants over the course of seven years and sought to explore how power walking influenced mortality rates using accelerometers, devices that measure changes in velocity, to track physical activity. Of the folks studied, 53 percent were women, and among other findings, the study revealed one major insight into how much you need to power walk to reap the longevity benefits.
            Drum roll, please: The research indicated that if everyone were to start power walking for an extra 10 minutes a day, we could prevent more than 111,000 deaths every year. Meaning, in theory, if you’re not walking at all right now, just 10 minutes is enough to start extending your lifespan. And if you’re already spending time strolling, you’d need to add an extra 10 minutes at a faster clip to reap the rewards.`,

            body:`Volleying a ping-pong ball back and forth may not seem like much of a sport. After all, it usually doesn’t require any real athletic prowess, excepting the occasional lunge after a rogue hit. But when you delve into the mechanics of the activity, there’s far more than meets the eye (or hand). As you step from side to side, strategize your next shot, and reach to hit the ball, a whole bunch of systems fire in the brain and body, making regular table tennis sessions a secret boon for longevity.
            If anyone should know that link first-hand, it’s family-practice physician Danine Fruge, MD, medical director at Pritikin Longevity Center (where she often points visitors to on-site table tennis) and a former NCAA Division I tennis player. “I had my first experience with tennis and longevity when I taught people at a country club who were in their 90’s,” she says. “And I noticed two things: There was something about practicing a racket sport that seemed to keep these people young, and they were always having fun while they played.”
            Research backs her up: Racket sports (like tennis, badminton, and squash) have been proven to be one of the top categories of sport for increasing lifespan. But not everyone has access to a court—or the knees or energy to run back and forth on one, Dr. Fruge caveats. That sparked her interest in table tennis, which involves many of the same motions and thought processes as tennis (and then some, given it can be even faster-paced), but requires no training or particular level of fitness to start playing. And you can even play it on practically any table with a retractable ping-pong net.`,

            body:`If you spend much time scrolling through TikTok, there’s a chance you’ve happened upon the recent trend of people walking backwards. Aside from looking rather bizarre, is there a reason for this switch up? Is good old-fashioned forward motion not enough anymore?
            Steve Burden, a certified trainer, says the main benefit of walking backwards is that it’s more cardiovascularly and metabolically challenging for the body than walking normally. “This makes it an effective way to develop your cardiovascular system, without the kind of impact and strain associated with traditional activities that require you to move at a faster pace,” he explains. “It also offers a way to fit cardio into shorter sessions, as making your heart work harder means you won’t have to perform the activity for as long to achieve the same results.”
            Burden adds that another benefit of walking backwards is that you have to focus harder and pay much more attention to what you are doing, since you can’t see where you are going. “This will help to improve your coordination and give you better control over your body,” he says. That coordination work can pay off. Studies show walking backwards can boost your balance as well. And, compared to forward walking, walking backwards places different stresses and demands on the muscles and joints in the lower body, helping build strength and reducing overuse injuries.`,

            The latest iteration of must-try meals brought to you by none other than TikTok is best served at breakfast. This two-ingredient, heart-healthy avocado hash brown recipe is just as good—if not better—than avocado toast. (We said what we said.) How can this even be possible? It’s all in the bread... or in this case, the super crispy, crunchy hash brown that’ll make any potato aficionado instantly swoon.
            Why this avocado hash brown recipe is so much better than regular avo toast
            If you’re ready to take it back to the '90s when your parents still had to drive you everywhere and breakfast meant an obligatory pitstop at the local Mickey D’s, this recipe is for you. One of our favorite parts about a kid’s breakfast Happy Meal (aside from the fun toy, obvi) was the golden hash brown that comes individually wrapped in a white paper sleeve to sop up the excess oil. While we can never be too old to feed our inner child a sweet and savory McGriddle breakfast sandwich, replicating this drive-thru-worthy meal at home has never been easier thanks to our beloved supermarket, Trader Joe’s.`,

            description:`Whenever I get my hands on a bag of pretzels, it always feels like I can’t put it down until the whole thing is gone. After consuming far too much sodium in one sitting, my mouth starts to feel like the desert in a heat wave, I get a sudden urge to chug all five of the Great Lakes, and I immediately wish I hadn’t eaten all of it at once.`,
            body:`Whenever I get my hands on a bag of pretzels, it always feels like I can’t put it down until the whole thing is gone. After consuming far too much sodium in one sitting, my mouth starts to feel like the desert in a heat wave, I get a sudden urge to chug all five of the Great Lakes, and I immediately wish I hadn’t eaten all of it at once. Though it was so good... #noregrets. However, that’s to say, like most things in life, even the best of salty snacks are about moderation.
            Of course, we know that sodium is important for biological functioning, and you can, in fact, fall into a sodium deficiency if you don’t have enough of it. Plus, it’s one of a chef’s favorite not-so-secret ingredients for creating super flavorful dishes. However, according to the CDC, consuming too much of it can potentially lead to high blood pressure, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.
            So, does that mean we’re fated to only eating bland, flavorless food forever if we want to keep our health in tip-top shape? Definitely not. In fact, a recent study by the European Society of Cardiology that analyzed the effects of taste adaptation intervention (aka the results of eating less sodium) showed that your taste buds can actually acclimate—and even learn to very much enjoy—a diet lower in salt. To understand how to train your taste buds to enjoy foods lower in salt, we spoke with a registered dietitian and the study's lead researcher to learn how.`,

So, to guarantee no chip goes queso-less this Labor Day, we found the best “cheesy” recipe of your dreams. Seven staple pantry ingredients, five minutes, and one blender are all you need to whip up this five-minute *vegan* cashew queso dip recipe by Minimalist Baker. Challenge accepted.
            What makes this vegan cashew queso dip recipe so good?
            Aside from the (creamy and dreamy) obvious, this easy queso recipe is gluten-free, vegan, and free from artificial ingredients. Plus, it’s packed with three grams of protein per serving, thanks to cashews, which are one of the best types of nuts for skin and bone health. Cashews contain a high amount of copper (aka 622 micrograms per ounce of the nut), which is about 70 perfect of the daily recommended amount for adults, Nora Minno, RDN, a dietitian and certified personal trainer in New York City, previously told Well+Good. Copper, Minno explains, helps stave off osteoporosis and maintain collagen and elastin, which are both important for skin health and bone density.`,

If you're ready to learn more about the rich history of Tajín, its many health benefits, and how to use it in every dish you serve, read on.
            What is Tajín, and where did it come from?
            The story goes that Tajín was born on December 23, 1985 in Guadalajara, a western city in Mexico. The product had a humble start, with the owners selling the bottles one by one to local stores before expanding their business. After finding great success in the Mexican market, Tajín made its way to the United States in the early '90s. At the start of the 2000s, the product underwent some minor makeover adjustments and began exploring its worldwide potential in continents like Europe, Asia, and Africa. Today, the product can be found in more than 30 countries globally, and proudly represents some of the bold and delicious flavors of Mexican cuisine.`,
